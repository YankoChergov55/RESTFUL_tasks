# RESTful Task Manager

## Overview

The RESTful Task Manager is a Node.js-based application designed to manage tasks efficiently using a RESTful API. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a robust and scalable solution for task management.

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.
- **Express**: Web application framework for building the RESTful API.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, used to manage data.
- **Joi**: Validation library for JavaScript, ensuring data integrity.
- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for logging requests.
- **Dotenv**: Module for loading environment variables from a .env file.

## Features Implemented

1. **Task Management**:

   - Create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks.
   - Manage task statuses and priorities.

2. **Basic API Endpoints**:

   - Endpoints to manage tasks with CRUD operations.
   - `GET /tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
   - `GET /tasks/:id`: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
   - `POST /tasks`: Create a new task.
   - `PUT /tasks/:id`: Update an existing task by ID.
   - `DELETE /tasks/:id`: Delete a task by ID.
   - `GET /tasks/filter`: Filter tasks based on query parameters (status, date range, tags, etc.).

3. **Data Validation with Joi**

   - Use Joi for data validation to ensure the integrity of task data.

4. **Logging**:
   - Log HTTP requests to the console using Morgan.

## Future Features

1. **Subtasks**:

   - Allow tasks to have subtasks.
   - Add endpoints to manage subtasks.
   - Track completion progress based on subtasks.

2. **User Management**:

   - Add user authentication and authorization.
   - Allow task assignment to specific users.
   - Implement task sharing between users.
   - Add user roles (admin, regular user).

3. **Comments and Activity Log**:

   - Allow users to comment on tasks.
   - Track task history (status changes, updates).
   - Add endpoints to manage comments.

4. **Due Date Features**:

   - Add reminders/notifications for upcoming due dates.
   - Add overdue task filtering.
   - Implement recurring tasks.

5. **Bulk Operations**:

   - Add endpoints for bulk create/update/delete operations.
   - Allow moving multiple tasks between statuses.

6. **Statistics and Reporting**:

   - Add endpoints to get task completion statistics.
   - Generate reports on task status distribution.
   - Track time spent on tasks.

7. **Data Export/Import**:

   - Add endpoints to export tasks in various formats (CSV, JSON).
   - Allow bulk import of tasks.

8. **Task Dependencies**:

   - Allow marking tasks as dependent on other tasks.
   - Prevent completing tasks if dependencies aren't met.

9. **API Improvements**:
   - Add rate limiting.
   - Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
   - Add request validation middleware.
   - Improve error handling with detailed error messages.
   - Add API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI.
